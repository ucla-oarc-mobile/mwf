1. FRAMEWORK

The UCLA Mobile Web Framework is a cross-platform web framework that focuses
on mobile web standards, semantic markup, device agnosticism and graceful
degradation, providing a robust presentation layer that allows applications
to define a single set of markup optimized for HTML 5 capable devices that
degrades gracefully to any HTML 4.01 or XHTML MP compliant device
including Blackberry, Windows Mobile and even T9 phones.

==============================================================================

2. INITIATIVE

The framework project began in early 2010 as a joint venture between the UCLA
Office of Information Technology and UCLA Communications as a means to reach
all campus mobile users via a single platform in a reasonable and cost-
effective manner.

The framework first went into production at the beginning of Fall 2010 with
the launch of UCLA Mobile. Over ten campus units are now participating at UCLA
and four other campuses in the UC system have launched production applications
using the framework.

A number of other institutions both in the UC and beyond are currently
involved in the initiative.
