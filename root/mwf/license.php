You may use this Software WITHOUT CHARGE for any purpose, subject to the 
restrictions in this license. Some of those allowable uses or purposes which can

software or any modifications ("Derivative Work") of this software and beyond 
that, you must share your changes to the Mobile Web Framework with UCLA and the 
MWF Community. We want everyone to benefit from the use of this product, we want
it to stay free, and we want to avoid it forking (or splintering) into 
disconnected versions. Therefore; you may not use or distribute this Software or
 any Derivative Works in any form for any purpose. Examples of prohibited 
purposes would be licensing, leasing, or selling the Software, or distributing 
the Software for use with other commercial products, or incorporating the 
Software into a commercial product.')
