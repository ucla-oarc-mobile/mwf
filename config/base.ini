; URL of the mobile site home page in mwf.site.webroot(). You can use a 
;   protocol-less URL (starting with //) to seemlessly handle HTTP and HTTPS.
;   Do not include a trailing slash.

; URL of the assets folder in mwf.site.webassetroot(). You can use a 
;   protocol-less URL (starting with //) to seemlessly handle HTTP and HTTPS. Do 
;   not include a trailing slash.

; Directory for files generated by the MWF framework, such as cache files. While
;   MWF will still work if this directory is not writable by the web server, 
;   performance may be improved if it is.  You should not need to set this 
;   typically, as MWF will use the var directory in the MWF distribution.  If 
;   you wish to set it to cache elsewhere, use an absolute path and do not use a
;   trailing slash.
