AUTOMATED TESTS IN IPHONE SIMULATOR -- INSTALLATION:

You must be using Mac OS X and XCode 4.2 or later.

The tests currently assume that you have your MWF site running on your machine and
accessible at http://localhost/.

* Add Cucumber to your Ruby environment:

    sudo gem install cucumber

* Add RSpec to your Ruby environment:

    sudo gem install rspec

* Add Capybara to your Ruby environment:

    sudo gem install capybara

* Get iWebDriver code:

    svn checkout http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ selenium-read-only

* Open iWebDriver code in XCode:

    open selenium-read-only/iphone/iWebDriver.xcodeproj/

* Set target for iPhone Simulator:

  In XCode, use dropdown menu in top left, select "iWebDriver" and "iPhone 5.0 Simulator"

* Install iWebDriver on the iPhone Simulator:

  In XCode, select "Run"


RUNNING THE TESTS:

* In mwf/test directory:

  cucumber


NOTE:

Unfortunately, there appears to be no easy way to instruct Cucumber/Capybara/Selenium/iWebDriver
that the Simulator should accept the Geolocation popup, so that portion of the interaction
must be handled manually.
